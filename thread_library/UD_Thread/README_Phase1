For my convenience, I implemented a generic doubly linked
list in C and used it in my program. This saves a lot of 
time and provides some error checking functionalities that
may make my program more robust.

The generic linked list was implemented in files 
   list.h
   list.c

In order to prevent any new tcb get polluted by any dirty
chunks of memory, I used calloc(3) function for every
memory allocation.

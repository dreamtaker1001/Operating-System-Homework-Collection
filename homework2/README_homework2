 Program structure.
------------------------

   a. headers

      shell.h: 
        struct and function declarations about the shell environment.

      cmd.h: 
        struct and function decls about all built-in commands.

      sighand.h: 
        function decls for signal handler function.

   b. C source files

      shell.c:
        Contains most of the global variables about the shell environment.
        Also contains shell initialization functions and functions about
        garbage collection.
        Contains the MAIN function.
      
      cycle.c:
        Contains functions used in every cycle of execution of the shell.
        Makes judgments on whether the typed-in command is built-in cmds
        or out-source ones and call the functions accordingly.

      dir.c:
        Contains functions of built-in cmd pwd, cd, ls and wildcard handlers.

      env.c:
        Contains functions of built-in cmd printenv and setenv.

      exec.c:
        Contains functions of executing out-source cmds. Also deals with
        timeout options, which is extra credit~~~

      self.c:
        Contains functions about the environment of the shell itself:
        pid, prompt, alias, history.

      signal.c:
        Deals with everything involved with signals. built-in cmds kill included.

      which.c:
        Contains functions on built-in cmds which. "where" makes use
        of this too.
